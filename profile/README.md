# About our solution
The lack of physical activity among modern people has been a serious problem in many nations. The wonder app tries to fix this problem with our unique approach to walking exercises.

We added some gamification feature to help users enjoy walking in their daily lives. The user is encouraged to walk on daily basis, through various motivations and game-like mechanics we provide.

In addition, we connect local volunteering organizations with users so that they can participate in various volunteer activities that involves some 'walking' in the progress. For example, there are volunteer activities to take a walk with dogs at a dog shelter or lunch box delivery services for the elderly living alone. This way, walking is not just a daily experience, but also a way to help others and contribute to society.
